# pentest_nmap_metaspoit
This script uses the subprocess module to run three popular penetration testing tools: Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit. It first scans for open ports and services using Nmap, then runs Nessus to scan for vulnerabilities. Finally, it uses Metasploit to exploit known vulnerabilities. Of course, this is just a basic example, and a real-world penetration test would require more customization and manual intervention.
